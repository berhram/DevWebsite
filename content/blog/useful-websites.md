summary: Use cases and illustrations

Date: 2024-12-22

## Introduction

In my not-so-long career as an Android Developer, I have worked on completely different projects: 10 year old Java apps, glossy bleeding edge AI assistants and many other in between. To cut a long story short, below is a list of websites/web tools I have used so far, with descriptions and use cases they help me solve. You may not need them now, but I recommend saving them just in case.  
  
*Disclaimer! This is a list of tools, not online resources for Android Developers.*
